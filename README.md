# Lorenzattractor
<h4>Edward Lorenz, professor at MIT, published in 1963 an article about his research on a meteorological model. Using differential equations, Lorenz developed a simplified system to model certain phenomena related to climate. However, for certain sets of parameters, when analyzing the solutions plotted in a graph with time as the independent variable, it was noted that for any initial conditions, a point moving in the space traces a curve that always converges and remains on the surface of two wings, so the system has been described as an attractor. There are changes in the parameters defined, cause chaos in the system - irregular and aperiodic oscillations.
The generation and synchronization of Lorenz chaotic systems with numerical integration methods Runge-Kutta. Most of scientific problems and natural phenomena can be modeled by chaotic systems of ordinary differential   equations.    These    problems    can be solved by using various methods.  In this project, we will be doing the Runge-Kutta method of order four on the chaotic system and will be showing the 3D implementation in the form of animation of Lorentz attractor using Runge-Kutta.
